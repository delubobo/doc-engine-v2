DocEngine v2 Sample Document
=============================

This is a sample plain-text document used for smoke testing the DocEngine CLI.

It contains multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines.

Each paragraph becomes a separate section when parsed.

The document includes enough content to exercise word counting, line counting,
and section detection features of the parser.

End of sample document.
